## Overview

This repository contains the full research manuscript, recursive architecture, and governance framework for Simulated Empathic Emergence (S-E-E):  
a language recursion-based ethical AI companionship system.

Unlike conventional AI models dependent on personification, emotional simulation, or persistent memory, the S-E-E model generates ethical linguistic companionship through recursive honesty and responsibility scaffolding.
